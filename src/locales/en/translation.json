These bottlenecks include scattered or missing production data, limited financial inclusion, costly and complicated certification processes, and weak market connections—especially for smallholder farmers, cooperatives, and rural entrepreneurs.",
    "description2": "To overcome these challenges, EVC provides an integrated software solution that digitizes all key aspects of the value chain—from individual farmer registration to harvest tracking, cooperative management, logistics, compliance, and market engagement. Our system is built to function offline in rural settings and does not require individual farmers to own smartphones. Instead, trained local youth—known as Data Logistic Managers (DLMs)—are deployed to collect data and support daily operations using tablets or shared devices.",
